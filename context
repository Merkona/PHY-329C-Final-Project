PROJECT: Josephson Junction Artificial Atom Simulator (RCSJ-based)

GOAL:
Build a Python package that simulates Josephson junction dynamics using the RCSJ model, and uses these simulations to explore artificial atom behavior, energy levels, and multi-junction structures. The project includes ODE simulation, visualization, and future Hamiltonian modeling.

CORE PHYSICS:
A Josephson junction with critical current Ic, capacitance C, and shunt resistance R is modeled by the RCSJ equation. After nondimensionalization, the equation is:

    phi'' + alpha * phi' + sin(phi) = i_dc + i_ac * cos(Omega * tau + phi_drive)

Where:
- phi is the superconducting phase
- tau is dimensionless time: tau = omega_p * t
- omega_p = sqrt(2e Ic / (ħ C))
- alpha = 1 / sqrt(beta_c)
- beta_c = Stewart-McCumber parameter = (2e Ic R^2 C / ħ)
- i_dc = I_dc / Ic
- i_ac = I_ac / Ic
- Omega = omega_drive / omega_p

ODE state variables are:
    y = [phi, phi_dot]

The solver evolves phi(tau) and phi_dot(tau).

PROJECT REQUIREMENTS:
1. A unified parameter naming system
2. Clean class-based structure
3. Expandable architecture for multi-junction systems and quantum Hamiltonians

RECOMMENDED CLASS STRUCTURE:

Class 1: RCSJParams
    - Holds physical parameters: Ic, C, R, I_dc, I_ac, omega_drive, phi_drive
    - Stores derived dimensionless parameters: omega_p, beta_c, alpha, i_dc, i_ac, Omega
    - A helper function computes all derived values.

Class 2: RCSJModel
    - Stores RCSJParams
    - Implements the ODE: returns [phi_dot, phi_ddot]
    - Provides methods to compute the drive term and potential energy

Class 3: RCSJSolver
    - Wraps scipy.solve_ivp
    - solve(y0, tau_span, max_step=None)
    - Returns the ODE solution object

Class 4: JJVisualizer (optional at first)
    - Takes RCSJModel or solver output
    - Generates plots:
        - phi(tau)
        - phi_dot(tau)
        - phase portrait (phi vs phi_dot)
        - I-V curve (from averaged phi_dot)
        - Shapiro step diagrams (if AC drive is enabled)

CLASS INTERACTIONS:
- RCSJParams defines physical setup
- RCSJModel uses params to define ODE
- RCSJSolver integrates the model
- JJVisualizer plots results

INITIAL CONDITIONS STANDARD:
    phi0      = initial phase
    phi_dot0  = initial phase velocity
    y0 = [phi0, phi_dot0]

KEY DESIGN GUIDELINES:
- Keep all notation consistent across files
- Keep everything SI in params and dimensionless inside ODE
- Use dataclasses for parameters
