Final Group Project for PHY 329C 

## Title:
Exploring Josephson Dynamics

## Description:
Exploring Josephson dynamics in connection to the most recent Nobel prize in physics by modeling structures of the junctions in series and parallel. These models can be used to represent atoms, molecules, and the Kitaev chain

## Chronological Structure:
- Research physics and mathematical structure of the Josephson array
- Research how Josephson arrays can model atoms/molecules
- Code a simulation of Josephson arrays
- Research physics and Hamiltonian for Kitaev Chain
- Code a simulation of the Kitaev Chain in context of a Josephson array construction

## Contributions:
Ellie: Focus on implementing Python code for different concepts.
Chetan/Tyler: Focus on research modeling atoms/molecules using Josephson arrays.
Austin: Focus on Josephson arrays and application to Kitaev Chains.
